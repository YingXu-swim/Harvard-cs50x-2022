-- step 1: find correspond description
-- return:
-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery. Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€“ each of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery.
-- Littering took place at 16:36. No known witnesses.
-- key: 10:15am, Humphrey Street bakery, three witnesses,
select * from crime_scene_reports where year = 2021 and month = 7 and day = 28 and street like '%Humphrey Street%';

-- step 2: find intervie
-- we can see id is 159 - 163, 191.
-- 3 witnesses's interview report should be continuously. According to the content, we can infer that 161-163 is the correspond intervie.
-- key:
-- Ruth : bakery parking(within ten minutes of the theft);
-- Eugene: recognized, thief in ATM(Leggett Street, Earlier this morning);
-- Raymond: CALL(less than a minute, As the thief was leaving the bakery), earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow(booked by accomplice).

-- analyse Eugene's interview
-- analyse related ATM records, we can also find Taylor's information. Once again revealing that he is the thift.
-- consider this as list2
